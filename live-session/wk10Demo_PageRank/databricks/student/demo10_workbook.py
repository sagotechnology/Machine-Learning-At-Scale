# MAGIC %md Last week we introduced graphs and their applications. We looked at the specific challenges with parallelizing graph traversal and in particular the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm. In class today we'll look at another famous algorithm called PageRank which is an implementation of the Markov Chain, and which established Google as one of the world's most popular search engines.

# MAGIC %md __Identifying Special Nodes__ (Centrality): There are many ways to define what 'special' means, including metrics based on node in-degree, average distance to other nodes, and relationship to cluster structure. These special nodes are important to investigators attempting to break up terrorist cells, epidemiologists modeling the spread of diseases, advertisers trying to promote products, and many others. In particular, eigenvector centrality is used to find popular webpages using the PageRank algorithm, which in turn has been extended to Text summarization, Keyword extraction/Concept extraction using TextRank.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### A few examples of graph centrality measures
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Notation:__
# MAGIC The neighborhood of a vertex \\(v\\) in graph \\(G\\) is defined as a set of neighbors of a vertex \\(v\\) and is denoted by \\(N(v)\\). The neighborhood size is the number of immediate neighbors to a vertex. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The number of edges between all neighbors of a vertex is denoted by \\(E(v)\\). In the directed graph, the set of \\(N\_{in}(v)\\) is the set of vertices that point to a vertex \\(v\\) (predecessors) and set of \\(N\_{out}(v)\\) is the set of vertices that vertex \\(v\\) points to (successors).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Clustering coefficient
# MAGIC The clustering coefficient of a vertex measures the density of edges among the immediate neighbors of a vertex. It determines the probability of the presence of an edge between any two neighbors of a vertex. It is calculated as a ratio between the number of edges \\(E\_i\\) that actually exist among these and the total possible number of edges among neighbors: 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC c(v) = \frac{2E(v)}{|N(v)|(|N(v)|-1)}
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Degree Centrality
# MAGIC The degree \\(d(v)\\) of a vertex 𝑣 is the number of edges at \\(v\\); it is equal to the number of neighbors of \\(v\\). The degree centrality \\(C\_d(v)\\) of a vertex \\(v\\) is defined as the degree of the vertex. It can be normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible degree \\(N - 1\\):
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC C\_d(v) = \frac{d(v)}{N-1}
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Betweenness centrality 
# MAGIC The betweenness centrality \\(C\_b(v)\\) of a vertex \\(v\\) quantifies the number of times a vertex acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other vertices. Let \\(\sigma\_{out}\\) be the number of the shortest paths from vertex \\(u\\) to vertex \\(t\\) and let \\(\sigma\_{out}(v)\\) be the number of those paths that pass through the vertex \\(v\\). The normalized betweenness centrality of a vertex \\(v\\) should be divided by the number of all possible edges in the graph and is given by:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC C\_b(v) = \frac{2\sum\_{v\ne u\ne t}\frac{\sigma\_{ut}(v)}{\sigma\_{ut}}}{(N-1)(N-2)}
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Closeness centrality 
# MAGIC In a connected graph, closeness centrality (or closeness) of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Thus, the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes. When speaking of closeness centrality, people usually refer to its normalized form which represents the average length of the shortest paths instead of their sum. It is generally given by:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC C\_{closeness}(v) = \frac{|V|}{\sum\_u d(u,v)}
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC where where \\(|V|\\) is the number of vertices in the graph, and \\(d(u,v)\\) is the distance between vertices \\(v\\) and \\(u\\). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Eigenvector centrality   
# MAGIC The eigenvector centrality \\(C\_{EV}(v)\\) measures the centrality of a vertex \\(v\\) as a function of the centralities of its neighbors. For the vertex \\(v\\) and constant \\(\lambda\\) it is defined:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC C\_{EV}(v) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum\_{u\in N(v)} C\_{EV}(u)
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In the case of weighted networks, the equation can be generalized. Let \\(w\_{uv}\\) be the weight of edge between vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) and \\(\lambda\\) a constant. The eigenvector centrality of a vertex \\(v\\) is given by:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC C\_{EV}(v) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum\_{u\in N(v)} w\_{uv} \times C\_E(u)
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The PageRank centrality is based on the eigenvector centrality measure and implements the concept of "voting". The PageRank score of a vertex \\(v\\) is initialized to a default value and computed iteratively until convergence using the following equation:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC C\_{pagerank}(v) = (1-d) + d \sum\_{u \in N\_{in}(v)} \frac {C\_{PageRank}(u)}{|N\_{out}(u)|}
# MAGIC $$
# MAGIC where \\(d\\) is the damping factor set between 0 and 1 (usually set to 0.85).

# MAGIC There are over 4 billion internet users in 2019, and nearly 2 billion websites. Each of those websites can have multiple pages, and Google only crawls a fraction of them.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Wikipedia alone consists of almost 6 million articles, and nearly 50 million wiki pages.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### So how does Google decide which pages are "relevant"?
# MAGIC https://stanford.edu/~rezab/classes/cme323/S15/notes/lec7.pdf
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The goal is to find a good metric for measuring the importance of each node (page) in the graph (corresponding to a ranking over the websites). A website’s importance will be measured by the number of sites that link to it. Ideally, we would like the amount of importance conferred on a website by receiving a link to be proportional to the importance of the website giving the link. (*the centrality of a vertex \\(v\\) as a function of the centralities of its neighbors - see eignvector centrality definition above*)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md We can formalize this intuition via the process of a random walk. We would like to model a __random surfer__ who is traversing the web with uniform probability of following any link outgoing from the page the surfer is currently on. We are intersted in the behavior of this random surfer in the limit as she takes an infinite number of jumps.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md To express this in linear algebra, we will make use of the adjacency matrix, \\(A\\), and a out-degree matrix \\(D\\), where:

# MAGIC %md <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/master/images/wk10-demo/rezab-01.png">

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Let \\(Q = D ^{-1} A\\). This forms the transition matrix of the random-walker. Given the current state
# MAGIC of the walker each row of the matrix gives the probability the walker will transition to each new
# MAGIC state.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/master/images/wk10-demo/rezab-02.png">

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md It’s interesting to note that \\(Q^k_{ij}\\) is equal to the probability of going from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\) in exactly \\(k\\) steps, in a random walk over graph \\(G\\). (The \\(k\\) steps are the time-steps, not to be confused with hops (*paths*))
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The __stationary distribution (or steady state)__ of the __Markov Chain__ with the transition probabilities defined by \\(Q\\) is the solution to our PageRank problem as defined above. The stationary distribution can be interpreted as the proportion of time on average is spent at a specific state (page) during an infinitely long random walk.

# MAGIC %md ## The origin of the Markov Chain by Britt Cruise
# MAGIC https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/moderninfotheory/v/markov_chains

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plato speculated that after an uncountable number of years, the universe will reach an ideal state, returning to its perfect form. But it wasn't until the 16th century that Bernoulli came along and refined the idea of expectation. He was focused on a method of accurately estimating the unknown probability of some event based on the number of times the event occurs in independent trials.
# MAGIC (pebbles in cups example). He went on to conclude "If observations of all events be continued for the entire infinity, it will be noticed that everything in the world is governed by precise ratios and a constant law of change." This became known as the weak __law of large numbers__.  This idea was quickly extended as it was noticed that not only did things converge on an expected average, but the probability of variation away from averages also follow a familiar, underlying shape, or distribution. This overall curvature, known as the binomial distribution, appears to be an ideal form as it kept appearing everywhere any time you looked at the variation of a large number of random trials (coin toss example). It seems the average fate of these events is somehow predetermined, known today as the __central limit theorem__.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This was a dangerous philosophical idea to some!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Nekrasov didn't like the idea of a predetermined statistical fate, and claimed that __Independence__ is a neccessary condition for the law of large numbers. Since independence just describes these toy examples using beans or dice, where the outcome of previous events doesn't change the probability of the current or future events. However, as we all can relate, most things in the physical world are clearly dependent on prior outcomes, such as the chance of fire or sun or even our life expectancy. When the probability of some event depends, or is conditional, on previous events, we say they are dependent events, or dependent variables.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This claim angered another Russian mathematician, Andrey Markov, who maintained a very public animosity towards Nekrasov. He goes on to say in a letter that "this circumstance prompts me to explain in a series of articles that the law of large numbers can apply to dependent variables", using a construction which he brags Nekrasov cannot even dream about! 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Markov extends Bernoulli's results to dependent variables using an ingenious construction. (*putting pebbles back into buckets depending on state*), and thus coining the __Markov property__. Let's explore what that looks like:

# MAGIC * What becomes steady? Do the states become steady? Does it mean that you will always be guaranteed to go from page i to page j?

# MAGIC %md # 2. Markov Chain via Power Iteration

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Recap:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * A __Markov chain__, named after Andrey Markov, is a  mathematical system that undergoes transitions  from one state to another, between a finite or  countable number of possible states.
# MAGIC * It is a __random process__ usually characterized as  __memoryless__: the next state depends only on the  current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
# MAGIC * This specific kind of "memorylessness" is called  the __Markov property__. Markov chains have many  applications as statistical models of real-world  processes.
# MAGIC * A Markov chain consists of __state vector__ of dimension \\(n\\) and an \\(n \times n\\) transition __probability matrix__ \\(P\\).
# MAGIC * At each time step \\(k\\), we are in exactly one of the states.
# MAGIC * For \\(1 ≤ i,j ≤ n\\), the matrix entry \\(P\_{ij}\\) tells us the  probability of \\(j\\) being the next state, given we are  currently in state \\(i\\).

# MAGIC %md ### Periodicity
# MAGIC * Well behaved graphs are aperiodic: The GCD (greatest common divisor) of all  cycle lengths is 1. The GCD is also called period.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Why is this important? Again, let's look at an example from the MIT videos.
# MAGIC Remember that the Markov Property of independence says that no matter where we start, the probability of transitioning to a given state does not change. In other words, we have a steady state distribution.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/master/images/wk10-demo/periodicity-01.png">
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you start at state 2, you have a 50/50 chance of going left or right. There is some randomness, but this randomness is limited. No matter whether you go left or right, you always come back to 2 in the next step. You go out, you go in, you go out, you go in - there is a periodic pattern that gets repeated.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC It means that if you start at state 2, after an even number of steps, you are certain to be back at state 2, so the probability is always 1 (for an even number of steps). If the number of transitions is odd, there is no way you can be at state 2. At odd number of steps, you will be at either the left or right, so the probability of being at state 2 is always 0.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As n (number of transitions) goes to infinity, this state 2 probability does not converge to anything. It keeps alternating between 0 and 1.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md __NO!__
# MAGIC If you start in a purple state, you can only go to a white state, and vs. Again, as N (number of transitions) goes to infinity, the probability of being in the purple or white state does not converge to anything. It keeps alternating between 0 and 1.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/master/images/wk10-demo/peridicity-fun-example-02.png">

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md If you are at a purple state, then the probability of going into a white state is 1. But if you are in a white state, then the probability of going to a white state is 0. No matter how many times you walk this graph (ie, ad infinitum), these probabilities will continue to oscillate, and __will never settle on a steady state distribution. Here the initial condition has an influence on the probabilities of being in each state.__

# MAGIC The state moves randomly, and as the state moves around randomly starting from the two initial states, on a random trajectory… as long as you have a single recurrent class, and you don’t have periodicity, at some point those two states (those trajectories) are going to collide. Just because there’s enough randomness there. After the state becomes the same, the future of those trajectories, probabilistically, is the same, because they both started in the same state.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC So this means that the initial conditions stopped having any influence.

# MAGIC ### Perron-Frobenius Theorem:
# MAGIC Any __irreducible, aperiodic, stochastic__ matrix \\(P\\) has an eigenvalue \\(\lambda\_0 = 1\\) with unique associated left eigenvector \\(e\_0 > 0\\). Moreover, all other eigenvalues \\(\lambda\_i\\) of \\(P\\) satisfy \\(|\lambda\_i| < 1\\).

# MAGIC ### Personalized PageRank
# MAGIC Markov models have also been used to analyze web navigation behavior of users. A user's web link transition on a particular website can be modeled using first- or second-order Markov models and can be used to make predictions regarding future navigation and to personalize the web page for an individual user.

# MAGIC > At web search, there are many signals which can represent relevance, for example, the anchor
# MAGIC texts and PageRank score of a web page. Incorporating
# MAGIC such information into the ranking model and automatically constructing the ranking model using machine
# MAGIC learning techniques becomes a natural choice. In web
# MAGIC search engines, a large amount of search log data, such
# MAGIC as click through data, is accumulated. This makes it
# MAGIC possible to derive training data from search log data
# MAGIC and automatically create the ranking model. In fact,
# MAGIC learning to rank has become one of the key technologies for modern web search.
