# MAGIC %md In this week's async you were introduced to a range of real life datasets whose underlying structure is best described as a graph. In class today we'll review common types of analysis to perform on graphs and key considerations for parallelizing these algorithms. We'll particularly focus on the 'Single Source Shortest Path' task using some toy graphs and a network derived from the `nltk` synonym database. By the end of the next two sessions, you will be able to:  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * ... __identify__ whether a dataset in row/column form can be interpreted as a graph.
# MAGIC * ... __choose__ a data structure to efficiently represent graphs for the purpose of parallel computaion.
# MAGIC * ... __recognize__ whether a problem lends itself to a path planning solution.  
# MAGIC * ... __describe__ the difference between BFS and DFS in terms of time and space complexity.
# MAGIC * ... __explain__ why dijkstra's algorithm is not embarassingly paralellizable.  
# MAGIC * ... __interpret__ the meaning of graph centrality metrics in the context of a specific problem or datset. (e.g. _the connection between eigenvector centrality and PageRank; bipartite graphs & recommender systems_.)

# MAGIC %md # Exercise 1. Graphs Overview
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you know from this week's async, graphs are ubiquitous in modern society and comprise an increasing proportion of big data problems. Your reading from chapter 5 of Lin & Dyer mentioned examples of graphs encountered by almost everyone on a daily basis include: the hyperlink structure of the web (simply known as the web graph), social networks (manifest in the flow of email, phone call patterns, connections on social networking sites, etc.), transportation networks (roads, bus routes, flights, etc.) and metabolic and regulatory network, which can be characterized as a large, complex graph involving interactions between genes, proteins, and other cellular products. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Depending on the nature of the nodes and edges, there are different kinds of questions we might want to ask. Here's a list of six of the most common types of graph analyses (_we'll be focusing on the first three over the course of the next few weeks_):
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Graph Search & Path Planning:__ Search algorithms on graphs are invoked millions of times a day, whenever anyone searches for travel directions on the web. Similar algorithms are also involved in friend recommendations and expert-finding in social networks. Path planning problems involving everything from network packets to delivery trucks represent another large class of graph search problems.

These special nodes are important to investigators attempting to break up terrorist cells, epidemiologists modeling the spread of diseases, advertisers trying to promote products, and many others. For example, eigenvector centrality is used to find popular webpages using the PageRank algorithm, which in turn has been extended to Text summarization, Keyword extraction/Concept extraction using TextRank.

# MAGIC %md __Minimum spanning trees:__ A minimum spanning tree for a graph G with weighted edges is a tree that contains all vertices of the graph and a subset of edges that minimizes the sum of edge weights. A real-world example of this problem is a telecommunications company that wishes to lay optical fiber to span a number of destinations at the lowest possible cost (where weights denote costs). This approach has also been applied to wide variety of problems, including social networks and the migration of Polynesian islanders.

# MAGIC %md # Exercise 2. Data Structures Review.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This lecture is focused on working with graphs in the context of MapReduce style design. We call this type of graph processing "vertex-centric", where the computations revolve around a single vertex and its edges. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One of the main challenges to "dividing and conquering" computations involving graphs is that the fundamental units of analysis (nodes and edges) carry information about each other so it often takes some careful planning to making sure that the appropriate information is co-located for the calculations we need to perform. Let's briefly review a few key data structures that will be of help. Note that these data structures are not unique to graph algorithms, though they will be particularly helpful for SSSP and PageRank.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __LIFO vs FIFO vs Priority queues__  
# MAGIC A queue is a data structure like a list with the added property of an expected order in which elements are added or removed. In most applications that ordering will be 'last in first out' (LIFO) or 'first in first out' (FIFO). The python double ended queue type `deque` ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html), [pymotw tutorial](https://pymotw.com/3/collections/deque.html)) is a convenient way to implement either a FIFO or LIFO queue. In contrast, a priority queue maintains a sorted order based on the values of the contents of the sequence so that removing an element will always retrieve the highest/lowest. We usually implement a priority queue in python using `heapq` ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/heapq.html), [pymotw tutorial](https://pymotw.com/2/heapq/)).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Adjacency Matrix vs Adjacency List__  
# MAGIC Adjacency Matrices and Lists are the most common ways to encode a graph. In each, the rows represent nodes and the contents represent edges. In fact, you are already familiar with these data structures from HW3... the co-occurance matrix was a type of adjacency matrix (where we used `1`s and `0`s to encode a connection between two words); similarly the stripes were a form of adjacency list (where instead of storing`0`s for pairs of words that didn't have the connection of being neighbors we just listed the neighbors for each node). Here's a toy graph and its adjacency list representation to refresh your memory:

# COMMAND ----------

# a graph is a list of nodes and edges
nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
edges = [('A', 'B', 1), 
         ('A', 'E', 5), 
         ('B', 'A', 2),
         ('B', 'C', 4),
         ('B', 'D', 2),
         ('B', 'E', 6),
         ('C', 'B', 5),
         ('C', 'D', 2),
         ('D', 'B', 7),
         ('D', 'C', 3),
         ('D', 'E', 3),
         ('E', 'A', 4),
         ('E', 'B', 1),
         ('E', 'D', 5),]
TOY_GRAPH = {'nodes' : nodes, 'edges' : edges}

# COMMAND ----------

# retrieving the adjacency list, 
# NOTE that we are discarding edge weights in the process of encoding
ADJ_GRAPH = {}
for node in TOY_GRAPH['nodes']:
    if node not in ADJ_GRAPH:
        ADJ_GRAPH[node] = []
        
    for edge in TOY_GRAPH['edges']:
        if edge[0] == node:
            ADJ_GRAPH[node].append(edge[1])

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md # Exercise 3. Graph Traversal.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For many of the common graph problems introduced in exercise 1 we'll need to systematically visit the nodes in a graph in some kind of order. The idea of "ordering" the nodes in a graph is a little different than "ordering" data in a traditional row/column format. Sometimes a node might be associated with a particular label or value, in which case we might use a sorting strategy just like regular data. However often we'll want to instead use the graph's underlying structure to sequentially examine nodes based on their location. There are two basic ways to do this: breadth-first (BFS) and depth-first (DFS).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Depth-First Search
# MAGIC __An analogy__   
# MAGIC An analogy you might think about in relation to depth-first search is a maze. The
# MAGIC maze—perhaps one of the people-size ones made of hedges, popular in England—
# MAGIC consists of narrow passages (think of edges) and intersections where passages meet
# MAGIC (vertices).
# MAGIC Suppose that someone is lost in the maze. She knows there’s an exit and plans to
# MAGIC traverse the maze systematically to find it. Fortunately, she has a ball of string and a
# MAGIC marker pen. She starts at some intersection and goes down a randomly chosen
# MAGIC passage, unreeling the string. At the next intersection, she goes down another
# MAGIC randomly chosen passage, and so on, until finally she reaches a dead end.
# MAGIC At the dead end she retraces her path, reeling in the string, until she reaches the
# MAGIC previous intersection. Here she marks the path she’s been down so she won’t take it
# MAGIC again, and tries another path. When she’s marked all the paths leading from that
# MAGIC intersection, she returns to the previous intersection and repeats the process.
# MAGIC The string represents the stack: It “remembers” the path taken to reach a certain
# MAGIC point.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Depth-First Search and Game Simulations__   
# MAGIC Depth-first searches are often used in simulations of games (and game-like situations
# MAGIC in the real world). In a typical game you can choose one of several possible actions.
# MAGIC Each choice leads to further choices, each of which leads to further choices, and so
# MAGIC on into an ever-expanding tree-shaped graph of possibilities. A choice point corresponds
# MAGIC to a vertex, and the specific choice taken corresponds to an edge, which leads
# MAGIC to another choice-point vertex.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Breadth-First Search
# MAGIC As we saw in the depth-first search, the algorithm acts as though it wants to get as
# MAGIC far away from the starting point as quickly as possible. In the breadth-first search, on
# MAGIC the other hand, the algorithm likes to stay as close as possible to the starting point.
# MAGIC It visits all the vertices adjacent to the starting vertex, and only then goes further
# MAGIC afield. This kind of search is implemented using a queue instead of a stack.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The breadth-first search has an interesting property: It first finds all the vertices that
# MAGIC are one edge away from the starting point, then all the vertices that are two edges
# MAGIC away, and so on. This is useful if you’re trying to find the shortest path from the
# MAGIC starting vertex to a given vertex. You start a BFS, and when you find the specified
# MAGIC vertex, you know the path you’ve traced so far is the shortest path to the node. If
# MAGIC there were a shorter path, the BFS would have found it already.

# MAGIC %md # Exercise 4. SSSP for unweighted graphs.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The "Single Source Shortest Path" (SSSP) problem is a particular kind of analysis for which we will need to traverse a graph. As implied by the name, when performing SSSP we assume that you have a particular 'starting node' in mind, and want to end up with a number that represents the 'length' of the most efficient route you could take to arrive at a destination (possibly also the path itself which would be a list of connected nodes). Note that in some cases we'll want to calculate this distance ___for all other nodes in the graph___, in others we'll have a ___particular destination node in mind___. Depending on which outcome we're seeking we'd make different design choices.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For an unweighted undirected graph, the 'length' of a path is just the number of edges that are part of that path. We can measure these distances easily by traversing the graph and incrementing counters each time we 'travel' an edge. While doing this traversal, we'll also keep track of which nodes have already been visited so that we can store their shortest distances and so that we know when we've fully traversed the graph. Note that in many graphs there will be more than one path from the source to a given node, in such cases we'll want a way to ensure that we're keeping track of the _shortest_ path not just the path that we happened to find first. BFS guarantees that the first path we find _will_ be the shortest (_can you explain why?_). Here's what it would look like:

# COMMAND ----------

    distance = 0
    # return path if start is goal
    if start == goal:
        return "That was easy! Start = goal"

    # keeps looping until all possible paths have been checked

        # pop the first path from the queue

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md # Exercise 6. Distributed SSSP

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md #### Graph algorithms typically involve:
# MAGIC - Performing computation at each node
# MAGIC - Processing node-specific data, edge-specific data, and  link structure
# MAGIC - Traversing the graph in some manner
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Key questions:
# MAGIC - How do you represent graph data in MapReduce?
# MAGIC - How do you process a graph in stateless MapReduce?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC *For maximum parallelism, you need the Maps and Reduces to be stateless, i.e. to not depend on any data generated in the same MapReduce job. You cannot control the order in which the maps run, or the reductions.*

# MAGIC - Visited
# MAGIC - Queue
# MAGIC - Unvisited
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Phase 1 - Initialize graph
# MAGIC - Start with Source node (node 1)
# MAGIC - Mark node 1 with distance=0 and tag Q “frontier queue.”
# MAGIC - Mark all other nodes in the unvisited state U, and distance inf

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### For each frontier node, expand(): 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Emit list of new frontier nodes tagged with `Q`, and `distance = distance + 1`. 
# MAGIC - Mappers dont know down stream edges from new frontier nodes: tag them as `Null`
# MAGIC - Old frontier updated to visited `V` (once a node has been expanded, we're done with it). 
# MAGIC - Emit all “unvisited nodes” `U`, with no change.
