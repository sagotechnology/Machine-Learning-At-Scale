Gradient descent allows us to find the model parameters that minimize a loss function, provided that the loss function is (pseudo) convex. Full batch GD is easy to parallelize, however the need to make many passes over the entire dataset is still a cost we'd like to minimize when processing large scale data. Today we'll dive a bit further into techniques for improving the training of supervised ML models. By the end of this live session you should be able to:\n* __... explain__ why and how we regularize linear and logistic regression models.\n* __... compare__ L1 and L2 regularization in terms of their effects on model parameters.\n* __... identify__ a few common gradient descent variants.\n* __... describe__ the numerical approximization method & when we might use it."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Notebook Set-Up"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# RUN THIS CELL AS IS\n# This code snippet reads the user directory name, and stores is in a python variable.\n# Next, it creates a folder inside your home folder, which you will use for files which you save inside this notebook.\nusername = dbutils.notebook.entry_point.getDbutils().notebook().getContext().tags().apply('user')\nuserhome = 'dbfs:/user/' + username\nprint(userhome)\ndemo7_path = userhome + \"/demo7/\" \ndemo7_path_open = '/dbfs' + demo7_path.split(':')[-1] # for use with python open()\ndbutils.fs.mkdirs(demo7_path)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">dbfs:/user/kylehamilton@ischool.berkeley.edu\nOut[2]: True</div>"]}}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import sys\n\n# Add the path to system, local or mounted S3 bucket, e.g. /dbfs/mnt/<path_to_bucket>\nsys.path.append('/dbfs/mnt/mids-w261/')\nsys.path.append('/dbfs/mnt/mids-w261/modules')\nsys.path.append('/dbfs/mnt/mids-w261/modules/demo7_helperFunc.py')\nsys.path.append('/dbfs/mnt/mids-w261/modules/demo7_homegrown.py')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Regularization: what and how? \n\nIn any supervised learning context we are concerned with making sure our trained models are going to generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques help us avoid overfitting. In general they boil down to strategicalling limiting the variance of a model so that we don't accidentally learn patterns in the noise of our data. As we learned early on this reduction in variance will come at the expense of a potential increase in bias. Early stopping is one of the most popular ways to do this but it requires that you are able to set aside a validation set which may not always be feasible, especially with very high dimensional data. Another strategy is to add a penalty term to the loss function when performing your gradient updates. In this section we'll return to the small example from last class to build some intuitions for what this looks like and how this works.\n\n### Demo 1: Small example revisited\n\nRun the provided code below to see how regularized and unregularized gradiet descent compare on our small example.

As you saw in chapter 6 of Intro to Statistical Learning:\n* __Ridge Regression__ adds an __l2__ penalty term to the OLS loss function:\n$$\n\\lambda\\sum\\_{i=1}^m (w\\_{i})^2\n$$\n* __LASSO Regression__ adds an __l1__ penalty term to the OLS loss function:\n$$\n\\lambda\\sum\\_{i=1}^m |w\\_{i}|\n$$\n\nEach of these penalty terms includes a hyperparameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\), which allows us to tune how strongly the penalty term changes the shape of the loss curve. It is important to note that by using this penalty term we aren't making a choice to measure _error_ differently, we are creating an entirely different equation to optimize instead. Also note that, unlike the loss function itself, the regularization term is _only_ a function of the weights (not including bias!) and does not depend on the data.\n\nRun the code below to view these penalty terms plotted in 3D. Try changing the regularization parameter to see how this affects the curves (hint, due to autoscaling of the plots you'll need to look carefully at the axes for this). Finally, modify the `REG_TYPE` to see how the OLS loss curve in the second row changes when a penalty term is added."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import demo7_helperFunc as hf\n\n#################### Demo Parameters #################### \n# TRY CHANGING THESE & SEE HOW IT AFFECTS OUR SEARCH\nREGULARIZATION_PARAMETER = 150\nREG_TYPE = 'l2'  # try 'l1' or 'l2'\n\n################### Penalized Loss Curves Demo #################### \n### small example data\nX = np.array([[1,1],[3,1],[5,1],[4,1],[2,1]])\ny = np.array([2,3,4,3,3])\ndata_domain = [0,5]\n\n### set up the grid for the surface plots\ngrid = np.mgrid[-5:5:0.5,-5:15:0.5]\nsize = int(np.product(grid.shape)/2)\nmodels_grid = grid.reshape(2,size)\n\n### plot comparison\ndisplay(hf.compareLossCurves(X, y, reg_type = REG_TYPE, reg_param = REGULARIZATION_PARAMETER, grid = models_grid))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["> __DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:__  \n * _Compare the l1 and l2 penalty curves?
