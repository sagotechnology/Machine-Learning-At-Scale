# wk3 Live Session Demo: Hadoop Shuffle

During this week's live session we go into more detail about the most importat part of the Hadoop MapReduce framework. We build on the syntax introduction from last week's class to prepare you to perform NaiveBayes using Hadoop Streaming in homework 2. As before, you'll do your work in  __`demo3_workbook.ipynb`__. Note that even if we don't get through all of the material in this live session you will need to be comfortable with the content from both notebooks in order to complete HW2. 

__`IMPORTANT:`__ _Please come to class prepared to share screen with your docker container up and the notebook running. We will be live coding in breakout session._
