# MAGIC %md # HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark
# MAGIC __`MIDS w261: Machine Learning at Scale | UC Berkeley School of Information | Fall 2018`__
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning. This is similar to the intuition behind the word2vec algorithm.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  
# MAGIC * ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.
# MAGIC * ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.
# MAGIC * ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.
# MAGIC * ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.
# MAGIC * ... __identify__ when it makes sense to take a stripe approach and when to use pairs
# MAGIC * ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __RECOMMENDED READING FOR HW3__:	
# MAGIC Your reading assignment for weeks 4 and 5 were fairly heavy and you may have glossed over the papers on dimension independent similarity metrics by [Zadeh et al](http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/disco.pdf) and pairwise document similarity by [Elsayed et al](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~oard/pdf/acl08elsayed2.pdf). If you haven't already, this would be a good time to review those readings, especially when it comes to the similarity formulas -- they are directly relevant to this assignment.

# MAGIC %md ### <--- SOLUTION --->
# MAGIC __SOLUTION__  
# MAGIC > __a)__ Spark is an open source parallel computation framework that started out as a research project at UC Berkeley designed to improve on some of the limitations of Hadoop MapReduce - particularly the facilitation of iterative and multi-stage jobs. Spark's core abstraction is the idea of the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), which are lazily evaluated collections of records. RDDs can include collections of Key-Value pairs (like Hadoop MapReduce) and Spark transformations comprise a wide range of 'map' and 'reduce' like higher order functions. Unlike Hadoop, Spark does not include its own distributed storage system & instead can be connected to existing resources like HDFS, Cassandra or S3 (for distributed storage) and YARN or Mesos (for cluster manager). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ Like, Hadoop MapReduce, Spark jobs emphasize stateless programming - transformations are applied in a distributed fashion and ideally depend only on the input record(s) or RDDs. However Spark's broadcast variables and accumulators are two examples of shared variables that allow the programmer to depart from strictly stateless algorithm design.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ Spark builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that representes the execution plan for your driver code. The DAG represents all of the transformations & their dependencies on previous intermediate RDDs/results. When the programmer calls an action Spark will run the minimal subgraph to create the desired result. In more complex jobs analyzing the DAG can help us understand how to streamline our implementation by adding `cache()` statements and avoiding redundant shuffles.

# MAGIC %md # Question 2: Similarity Metrics
# MAGIC As mentioned in the introduction to this assignment, an intuitive way to compare the meaning of two documents is to compare the list of words they contain. Given a vocabulary \\(V\\) (feature set) we would represent each document as a vector of `1`-s and `0`-s based on whether or not it contains each word in \\(V\\). These "one-hot encoded" vector representations allow us to use math to identify similar documents. However like many NLP tasks the high-dimensionality of the feature space is a challenge... especially when we start to scale up the size and number of documents we want to compare.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this question we'll look at a toy example of document similarity analysis. Consider these 3 'documents': 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC docA	the flight of a bumblebee
# MAGIC docB	the length of a flight
# MAGIC docC	buzzing bumblebee flight
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC These documents have a total of \\(7\\) unique words: 
# MAGIC >`a, bumblebee, buzzing, flight, length, of, the`.     
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Given this vocabulary, the documents' vector representations are (note that one-hot encoded entries follow the order of the vocab list above):
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC docA	[1,1,0,1,0,1,1]
# MAGIC docB	[1,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# MAGIC docC	[0,1,1,1,0,0,0]
# MAGIC ```  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q2 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ The cosine similarity between two vectors is $$\frac{A\cdot B}{\|A\|\|B\|}$$. Explain what the the numerator and denominator of this calculation would represent in terms of word counts in documents A and B. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Explain how the Jaccard, Overlap and Dice metrics are similar/different to the calculation for cosine similarity. When would these metrics lead to different similarity rankings for a set of documents? HINT: consider documents of very different lengths. It may be helpful to generate some small examples.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Calculate the cosine similarity for each pair of documents in our toy corpus. Please use markdown and \\(\LaTeX\\) to show your calcuations.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ According to your calculations in `part c` which pair of documents are most similar in meaning? __BONUS__: Does this match your expecatation from reading the documents? If not, speculate about why we might have gotten this result.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) short response:__ In NLP common words like '`the`', '`of`', and '`a`' increase our feature space without adding a lot of signal about _semantic meaning_. Repeat your analysis from `part c` but this time ignore these three words in your calculations [__`TIP:`__ _to 'remove' stopwords just ignore the vector entries in columns corresponding to the words you wish to disregard_]. How do your results change?

# MAGIC %md # Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This is where the idea of co-occurrance comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Consider the opening line of Charles Dickens' _A Tale of Two Cities_:

# COMMAND ----------

corpus = """It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, 
it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness"""

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are a total of 10 unique words in this short 'corpus':

# COMMAND ----------

words = list(set(re.findall(r'\w+', corpus.lower())))
print(words)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md But of these 10 words, 4 are so common that they probably don't tell us very much about meaning.

# COMMAND ----------

stopwords = ["it", "the", "was", "of"]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md So we'll ignore these 'stop words' and we're left with a 6 word vocabulary:

# COMMAND ----------

vocab = sorted([w for w in words if w not in stopwords])
print(vocab)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Your goal in the tasks below is to asses, which of these six words are most related to each other in meaning -- based solely on this short two line body of text.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q3 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Given this six word vocabulary, how many 'pairs' of words do we want to compare? More generally for a n-word vocabulary how many pairwise comparisons are there to make? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) code:__  In the space provided below, create a 'stripe' for each term in the vocabulary. This stripe should be the list of all other vocabulary words that occur within a 5 word window (two words on either side) of the term's position in the original text (In this exercise, use ['it', 'was', 'the','of'] as stopwords, just ignore them from your 5 word vectors).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Run the provided code to turn your stripes into a 1-hot encoded co-occurrence matrix. For our 6 word vocabulary how many entries are in this matrix? How many entries are zeros? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Complete the provided code to loop over all pairs and compute their cosine similarity. Please do not modify the existing code, just add your own in the spot marked.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) short response:__ Which pairs of words have the highest 'similarity' scores? __BONUS__: Are these words 'synonyms' in the traditional sense? In what sense are their meanings 'similar'? Explain how our results are contingent on the input text. What would change if we had a much larger corpus?

# MAGIC %md # Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you read in the paper by Zadeh et al, the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the "basis vocabulary" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revist the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q4 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. In the asynch videos about "Pairs and Stripes" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. In your own words, define each of these terms ('postings' and 'inverted index') based on your reading of the provided code. (*DITP by Lin and Dyer also contains a chapter on the Inverted Index although in the context of Hadoop rather than Spark. You may find the illustration in Chaprter 4 helpful in answering this question*).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __f) short response:__ Out of all the Spark transformations we make in this analysis, which are 'wide' transformations and which are 'narrow' transformations. Explain.

# MAGIC %md # About the Data
# MAGIC Now that you are comfortable with similarity metrics we turn to the main task in this assignment: "Synonym" Detection. As you saw in Question 3 the ability of our algorithm to detect words with similar meanings is highly dependent on our input text. Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For the main task in this portion of the homework you will use data from Google's n-gram corpus. This data is particularly convenient for our task because Google has already done the first step for us: they windowed over a large subset of the web and extracted all 5-grams. If you are interested in learning more about this dataset the original source is: http://books.google.com/ngrams/, and a large subset is available [here from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/google-books-ngrams/). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For this assignment we have provided a subset of the 5-grams data consisting of 191 files of approximately 10MB each. These files are available in dbfs. Please only use the provided data so that we can ensure consistent results from student to student.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Each row in our dataset represents one of these 5 grams in the format:
# MAGIC > `(ngram) \t (count) \t (pages_count) \t (books_count)`
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __DISCLAIMER__: In real life, we would calculate the stripes cooccurrence data from the raw text by windowing over the raw text and not from the 5-gram preprocessed data.  Calculating pairs on this 5-gram is a little corrupt as we will be double counting cooccurences. Having said that this exercise can still pull out some similar terms.

# MAGIC %md # Question 6: N-gram EDA part 2 (co-occurrences)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The computational complexity of synonym analysis depends not only on the number of words, but also on the number of co-ocurrences each word has. In this question you'll take a closer look at that aspect of our data. As before, please test each job on small "systems test" (Dickens ngrams) file and on a single file from the Ngram dataset before running the full analysis.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q6 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) code:__ Write a spark job that computes:
# MAGIC   * the number of unique neighbors (i.e. 5-gram co-occuring words) for each word in the vocabulary. 
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC  <pre>
# MAGIC   HINT: consider all words within a five-gram to be co-occuring. In other words, a word in a single 5-gram will always have 4 neighbors
# MAGIC   EXAMPLE:
# MAGIC     the dog ate cat litter 
# MAGIC     the cat has clean litter 
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC     Vocabulary:
# MAGIC     the, dog, ate, litter, cat, has, clean
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC     Neighbors:
# MAGIC     (the, dog) (the, ate) (the, cat) (the, littler), (dog, ate) (dog, cat) (dog, litter), (ate, cat) (ate, litter), (cat, litter)
# MAGIC     (the, cat) (the, has) (the, clean) (the, litter), (cat, has) (cat, clean) (cat, litter), (has, clean) (has, litter) (clean, litter)
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC     Unique neighbors:
# MAGIC     the 6
# MAGIC     dog 4
# MAGIC     ate 4
# MAGIC     litter 6
# MAGIC     cat 6
# MAGIC     has 4
# MAGIC     clean 4
# MAGIC  </pre>
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC   * the top 10 words with the most "neighbors"
# MAGIC   * the bottom 10 words with least "neighbors"
# MAGIC   * a random sample of 1% of the words' neighbor counts     
# MAGIC   __`NOTE:`__ for the last item, please return only the counts and not the words -- we'll go on to use these in a plotting function that expects a list of integers.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Use the provided code to plot a histogram of the sampled list from `a`. Comment on the distribution you observe. How will this distribution affect our synonym detection analysis?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code + short response:__ Write a Spark Job to compare word frequencies to number of neighbors.
# MAGIC     * Of the 1000 words with most neighbors, what percent are also in the list of 1000 most frequent words?
# MAGIC     * Of the 1000 words with least neighbors, what percent are also in the list of 1000 least frequent words?   
# MAGIC [__`NOTE:`__ _technically these lists are short enough to compare in memory on your local machine but please design your Spark job as if we were potentially comparing much larger lists._]

# MAGIC %md # Question 7: Basis Vocabulary & Stripes
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary'. Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q7 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) multiple choice:__ Suppose we were deciding between two different basis vocabularies: the 1000 most frequent words or the 1000 least frequent words. How would this choice impact the quality of the synonyms we are able to detect? How does this choice relate to the ideas of 'overfitting' or 'underfitting' a training set?
# MAGIC <pre>  
# MAGIC   MULTIPLE CHOICE:
# MAGIC    A. 1000 most frequent words would overfit, while 1000 least frequent words would underfit
# MAGIC    B. 1000 most frequent words would underfit, while 1000 least frequent words would overfit
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC   BONUS: Explain your answer 
# MAGIC </pre>
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ If we had a much larger dataset, computing the full ordered list of words would be extremely expensive. If we need to none-the-less get an estimate of word frequency in order to decide on a basis vocabulary, what alternative strategy could we take?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) multiple choice:__ Run the provided spark job that does the following:
# MAGIC   * tokenizes, removes stopwords and computes a word count on the ngram data
# MAGIC   * subsets the top 10,000 words (these are the terms we'll consider as potential synonyms)
# MAGIC   * subsets words 9,000-9,999 (this will be our 1,000 word basis vocabulary)    
# MAGIC   (to put it another way - of the top 10,000 words, the bottom 1,000 form the basis vocabulary)
# MAGIC   * saves the full 10K word list and the 1K basis vocabulary to file for use in `d`.  
# MAGIC <pre>
# MAGIC   What is another way to describe the Basis Vocabulary in machine learning terms?
# MAGIC   A. Stop-words
# MAGIC   B. Features
# MAGIC   C. Postings
# MAGIC   D. 1000-grams
# MAGIC </pre>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Write a spark job that builds co-occurrence stripes for the top 10K words in the ngram data using the basis vocabulary you developed in `part c`. This job/function, unlike others so far, should return an RDD (which we will then use in q8).

# MAGIC %md # Question 8: Synonym Detection
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We're now ready to perform the main synonym detection analysis. In the tasks below you will compute cosine, jaccard, dice and overlap similarity measurements for each pair of words in our vocabulary and then sort your results to find the most similar pairs of words in this dataset. __`IMPORTANT:`__ When you get to the sorting step please __sort on cosine similarity__ only, so that we can ensure consistent results from student to student. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Remember to test each step of your work with the small files before running your code on the full dataset. This is a computationally intense task: well designed code can be the difference between a 20min job and a 2hr job. __`NOTE:`__ _as you are designing your code you may want to review questions 3 and 4 where we modeled some of the key pieces of this analysis._
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q8 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ In question 7 you wrote a function that would create word stripes for each `term` in our vocabulary. These word stripes are essentially an 'embedded representation' of the `term`'s meaning. What is the 'feature space' for this representation? (i.e. what are the features of our 1-hot encoded vectors?). What is the maximum length of a stripe?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Remember that we are going to treat these stripes as 'documents' and perform similarity analysis on them. The first step is to emit postings which then get collected to form an 'inverted index.' How many rows will there be in our inverted index? Explain.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ In the demo from question 2, we were able to compute the cosine similarity directly from the stripes (we did this using their vector form, but could have used the list instead). So why do we need the inverted index?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Write a spark job that does the following:
# MAGIC   * loops over the stripes from Q7 and emits postings for the `term` _(key:term, value:posting)_   
# MAGIC   * aggregates the postings to create an inverted index _(key:term, value:list of postings)_
# MAGIC   * loops over all pairs of `term`s that appear in the same postings list and emits co-occurrence counts
# MAGIC   * aggregates co-occurrences _(key:word pair, value:count + other payload)_
# MAGIC   * uses the counts (along with the accompanying information) to compute the cosine, jacard, dice and overlap similarity metrics for each pair of words in the vocabulary 
# MAGIC   * retrieve the top 20 and bottom 20 most/least similar pairs of words
# MAGIC   * also return the cached sorted RDD for use in the next question  
# MAGIC   __`NOTE 1`:__ _Don't forget to include the stripe length when you are creating the postings & co-occurrence pairs. A composite key is the way to go here._  
# MAGIC   __`NOTE 2`:__ _Please make sure that your final results are sorted according to cosine similarity otherwise your results may not match the expected result & you will be marked wrong._
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC * __e) code:__ Comment on the quality of the "synonyms" your analysis comes up with. Do you notice anything odd about these pairs of words? Discuss at least one idea for how you might go about improving on the analysis.
