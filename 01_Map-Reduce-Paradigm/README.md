# Homework 1: Intro to the Map Reduce Paradigm

This first assignment is designed to introduce you to the Map Reduce paradigm and a few key skills you will need in subsequent assignments. Your work consists of 9 questions in **`hw1_Workbook.ipynb`**. Some of the items will instruct you to make modifications to the supplemental files we have provided. Please be sure to read all docstrings and inline comments closely. We will only grade code written in the designated spaces. If a question's instructions are unclear, please reach out for clarification on Slack. We expect each student to write their own code but collaboration without code sharing is encouraged.

### How to submit your work:
#### Step 1.
Submit your work by pushing your completed notebook and supplemental files to the master branch in your assigned student repository on Git. Do not make a pull request.    

The file structure should look like this:
```
<repo root>
    --Assignments
        --HW1
           |__hw1_Workbook.ipynb
           |__aggregateCounts.py
           |__pWordCount.sh
           |__wordCount.py
           |__README.md
           |__ <directory for scratchwork>
        --HW2
           |__ etc ...
     --HelpfulResources
     etc..
```
#### Step 2.
Please submit the link to your notebook (not just the directory, the actual notebook) using the following form:

### Tips:
* Make use of your peers and TAs by asking questions on Slack. Everyone comes to MIDs from a different background so don't be shy; all questions are welcome!
