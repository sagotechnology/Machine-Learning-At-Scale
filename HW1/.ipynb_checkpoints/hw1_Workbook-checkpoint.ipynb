    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

    "# Question 3: Tokenizing\n",
    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

    "> __d)__ Post-processing the output file is typically more efficient in this scenario.  In most implementations, the output file contains one key-value pair for each distinct token, while the corpus typically contains far more data.  Therefore, the output file requires less computation compared to the corpus.  The corpus size ultimately determines the best approach for the desired outcome.  Although both the post-processing and re-running the anlaysis approaches may have similar computation time if the corpus is relatively small.  However, in an application at scale where big data has undergone analysis, it's more efficient to post-process.  The point is this; as an algorithm scales, the reduced output file pales in comparison to the size of the input files."

    "> __a)__ The Big O complexity of the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithm is $O(n)$ at best.  Keep in mind that this performance occurs **at best** and is highly unlikely in real-world applications. For example, a bubble sort can perform $O(n)$ if it sorts a list in only one pass.  Otherwise, it performs $O(n^2)$, which is not desirable and occurs more often than not.  A comparison-based sorting algorithm such as mergesort, which is an efficient, general-purpose, and widely used sorting method, typically performs $O$ $(n$ $log$ $n)$.  Taking into consideration that algorithms will scale to big data, the fastest computation is regularly $O$ $(n$ $log$ $n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The default sorting algorithm in MapReduce is mergesort.  The Big O complexity of mergesort is $O$ $(n$ $log$ $n)$ for best, average, and worst-case performance.  This algorithm is a good choice for MapReduce because, at worst, it still performs well.  Most implementations produce a stable sort--meaning whenever there are two records R and S with the same key and R appears before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list.  Another benefit of mergesort is the ability to divide and conquer--meaning a mergesort job can run on multiple hardware in parallel for faster computation. "

It seems debatable that Lin and Dyer's criteria apply to this implementation.  The data stays the same, ruling out criteria one.  Regarding criteria two, merely partitioning the data across CPUs is not analogous to increasing the cluster size.  \n",

The decrease in computing time for two and four partitions is more than 1/2 and 1/4 the compute time of one partition, respectively.  Recall that Lin and Dryer require the algorithm to take no more than half as long to run, given the cluster size doubles.    \n",

However, the outcome is predictable when considering the mechanics of the implementation--let's take a look.  The step-by-step sequence and respective method of computation are as follows:\n",
    "> 1. Partition - sequential computing.  This step is a sunk cost and can not improve as it relates to run time.\n",
    "> 2. Mapper - parallel computing.  More resources will decrease run time.\n",
    "> 3. Sort - sequential computing.  Opportunities such as putting the sort into the mapper provide parallel capabilities, thereby reducing run time.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Understanding the framework is crucial to understanding why the overall run time increases as the number of partitions increase.  During the sort, merge, and reduce steps, the communication cost amongst these processes increases as the number of partitions increaese due to their sequential computing nature.  With more partitions, more data must be moved around--this takes time and explains the upward time to compute trend we observed.  This exercise points out the balance between parallelizing tasks and communication time across the network while scaling up.  Also, keep in mind that this cloud instance has four CPUs, thereby limiting the benefits of more partitions to four.\n",

    "> __d)__ Changing the number of partitions affects the process's chunking, mapping, sorting, merging, and reducing steps.  Note that moving sorting to the mapper creates a parallel computation for both the mapping and sorting steps, an advantage not yet utilized by this framework. As a rule of thumb, increasing partitions increases the time needed for sequential computations.  In this case, the time to partition, sort, merge, and reduce are all sequential processes; therefore, the time to complete their respective functions increases.  Mapping is the one step that benefits from increasing partitions but only to a certain extent.  The limiting factor corresponds to the number of CPUs on board the machine. "

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Remember that embarrassing parallel applies to computation capable of being divided into completely independent parts, each of which can execute on a separate processor as a self-contained process.  In the context of word counting, an EP framework describes the ability to chunk the input file, then run mappers, sort and shuffle, and finally utilize multiple reducers in parallel to produce output files of word-count key-value pairs.  EP is an implementation of a task.  It is not enough to run a job in parallel (a task); a framework must exist to exploit the benefits of end-to-end parallel computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ To consider computation as EP, the values of key-value pairs must possess associative and commutative properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The **associative property** describes an expression in which the sequence of operations are performed does not affect the outcome as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.  For example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> $(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 +4) = 9$  or $2 x (3 x 4) = (2 x 3) x 4 = 24$  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The **commutative property** describes an expression in which changing the order of the operands does not alter the result. For example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> $10 x 5 = 5 x 10 = 50$\n"
