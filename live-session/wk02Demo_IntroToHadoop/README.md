# wk2 Live Session Demo: Intro to Hadoop

This week's live session demo will give you a structured introduction to the Hadoop Streaming framework and syntax before you go on to use it to perform NaiveBayes in homework 2. You'll do your work in  __`demo2_workbook.ipynb`__. Although we may not get through all of this material in one live session you will need to be comfortable with the content from both notebooks in order to complete HW2. 

__`IMPORTANT:`__ _Please come to class prepared to share screen with your docker container up and the notebook running. We will be live coding in breakout session._
