In general they boil down to strategicalling limiting the variance of a model so that we don't accidentally learn patterns in the noise of our data. As we learned early on this reduction in variance will come at the expense of a potential increase in bias. Early stopping is one of the most popular ways to do this but it requires that you are able to set aside a validation set which may not always be feasible, especially with very high dimensional data.
