# W261 Machine Learning at Scale  

## Homework 1: Intro to the Map Reduce Paradigm
This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of Alice in Wonderland to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:

... describe the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.  
... explain why we consider word counting to be an "Embarrassingly Parallel" task.  
... estimate the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using "back of the envelope" calculations.  
... implement a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.  
... set-up a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.  
You will also become familiar (if you aren't already) with defaultdict, re and time in Python, linux piping and sorting, and Jupyter magic commands %%writefile and %%timeit.
