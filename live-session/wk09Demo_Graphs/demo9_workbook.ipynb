    "\n",
    "This lecture is focused on working with graphs in the context of MapReduce style design. One of the main challenges to \"dividing and conquering\" computations involving graphs is that the fundamental units of analysis (nodes and edges) carry information about each other so it often takes some careful planning to making sure that the appropriate information is co-located for the calculations we need to perform. Let's briefly review a few key data structures that will be of help. Note that these data structures are not unique to graph algorithms, though they will be particularly helpful for SSSP and PageRank.\n",

    "A queue is a data structure like a list with the added property of an expected order in which elements are added or removed. In most applications that ordering will be 'last in first out' (LIFO) or 'first in first out' (FIFO). The python double ended queue type `deque` ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html), [pymotw tutorial](https://pymotw.com/3/collections/deque.html)) is a convenient way to implement either a FIFO or LIFO queue. In contrast, a priority queue maintains a sorted order based on the values of the contents of the sequence so that removing an element will always retrieve the highest/lowest. We usually implement a priority queue in python using `heapq` ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/heapq.html), [pymotw tutorial](https://pymotw.com/2/heapq/)).\n",

In fact, you are already familiar with these data structures from HW3... the co-occurance matrix was a type of adjacency matrix (where we used `1`s and `0`s to encode a connection between two words); similarly the stripes were a form of adjacency list (where instead of storing`0`s for pairs of words that didn't have the connection of being neighbors we just listed the neighbors for each node).

As implied by the name, when performing SSSP we assume that you have a particular 'starting node' in mind, and want to end up with a number that represents the 'length' of the most efficient route you could take to arrive at a destination (possibly also the path itself which would be a list of connected nodes). Note that in some cases we'll want to calculate this distance ___for all other nodes in the graph___, in others we'll have a ___particular destination node in mind___. Depending on which outcome we're seeking we'd make different design choices.\n",

We can measure these distances easily by traversing the graph and incrementing counters each time we 'travel' an edge. While doing this traversal, we'll also keep track of which nodes have already been visited so that we can store their shortest distances and so that we know when we've fully traversed the graph. Note that in many graphs there will be more than one path from the source to a given node, in such cases we'll want a way to ensure that we're keeping track of the _shortest_ path not just the path that we happened to find first. BFS guarantees that the first path we find _will_ be the shortest (_can you explain why?_). Here's what it would look like:"
