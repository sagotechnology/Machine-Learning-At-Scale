    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop MapReduce programming model has its roots in functional programming.  It is a declarative programming paradigm, meaning it uses expressions.  In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the input arguments due to the higher-order function concept (functions that can accept other functions as arguments).  Map and reduce--aka fold, accumulate, compress, or inject--are examples of a higher-order function.  This programming style avoids state change, mutable objects and takes advantage of the embarrassing parallel framework--all critical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ In many ways, the shuffle is the heart of MapReduce and is where the \"magic\" happens. The shuffle is the process by which the system performs the sort and transfers the map outputs to the reducers. It is the synchronization process between the Map and Reduce phases. The shuffle is a network hot spot since it occurs after all mappers are complete then transfers the data as key-value pairs to the reducers.  Hadoop identifies which data pair gets allocated to each data node based on the key, at which point the data must be transferred.  Adding a combiner is one way to cut down on network traffic during the shuffle. A combiner will locally aggregate similar keys, therefore reducing the cost associated with the shuffle stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ A combiner is an aggregation script specified by the programmer.  It combines mapper output records with the same key, turning multiple key-value pairs with the same key into one.  This typically results in a faster shuffle because fewer records need transferring.  It is important to note that Hadoop uses combiners strategically.  Sometimes records are combined before leaving the mapper node or after arriving at a reducer node.  The fact that Hadoop does not guarantee using a combiner on any or all records limits the output of a combiner to having the same format as an input into a reducer.  In other words, the input and output format of a combiner must be the same.  In summary, Hadoop makes smart choices about when to hold data in memory, combine, or spill to disk.  These ultimately improve the shuffle \n",
    "efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ The level of parallelization in Hadoop is the culmination of a two-step Map and Reduce process.  The user can indirectly specify the number of map tasks for a given job using the mapred.min.split.size parameter in mapred-site.xml.  This parameter adjusts the input split size, which drives the number of mappers.  Keep in mind the size of the input split should typically match the block size for peak performance.  The user can specify the number of reducers using the -numReduceTasks parameter when invoking a Hadoop job.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The divide and conquer technique of parallel computing became readily available when standard/commodity and affordable architectures such as cloud computing emerged.  Clusters of commodity Linux nodes with CPU, memory, and disk along with gigabit ethernet interconnection prompted the adoption of parallel computation frameworks like Hadoop.  Increasing data size, availability, and the demand to leverage data served as the catalyst for the rapid growth of the data revolution."

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ There are two types of Hadoop counters, built-in and custom.  Built-in counters provide a way to measure the progress or number of operations during a MapReduce job.  Counters in Hadoop gather statistics about a job.  They are also helpful in diagnosing implementation issues.  There are five types of built-in counters: Task Counters, FileSystem Counters, FileInputFormat counters, FileOutputFormat Counters, and MapReduce Job Counters.  Specific examples include the following: Task Counters collect specific task information like the number of records read and written during execution.  FileSystemCounters track the number of bytes read and written by the file system.  A Custom Counter is a user-defined counter configurable using Java enum.  It allows users to define custom counting techniques that the mapper or reducer can increment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ A composite key contains multiple values used for sorting.  It is the combination of a key and a value or several values.  A technique called secondary sorting uses composite keys for sorting multiple fields rather than just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose we have input data containing the highest daily temperature for fifty years in the following format: yyyy ttt.  Our goal is to sort the data into a list of descending years and temperatures.  Secondary sorting using a composite key must be applied to meet this objective.  First, create the composite key of year and temp.  Using custom partitioning based on year only ensures records of the same year get sent to the same reduce task.  Once the grouped years are together, the reducer can use the composite key to sort by year and temp.  To summarize, composite keys allow the ability to sort by more than one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Custom partitioning and composite key techniques are used in tandem to achieve total ordered sort. The composite key allows the programmer to sort based on more than one value.  Custom partitioning assigns keys to partitions with guidance from the programmer, thereby ordering the values across multiple partitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The order inversion pattern allows the user to access the result of a computation in the reducer before processing the data needed for that computation.  This capability makes calculating relative frequencies possible.  Implementation relies on the user creating a new key prefixed by a character guaranteeing it to be the first result the reducer encounters after the sort.\n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb). You can skip the first two MRJob sections, but the rest of section III and all of section IV are **very** important (and apply to Hadoop Streaming) so make sure to read them closely. Feel free to read the Spark sections as well but you won't be responsible for that material until later in the course. To verify your understanding, answer the following questions.\n",

    "> **Unordered Total Sort:** Total unordered sort refers to ordering all key-value pairs based upon a specified key.  This sorting encompasses all partition files, unlike partial sort.  However, there is still some post-processing needed to handle the partition files.  \n",

    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Hadoop's architecture only guarantees partial sort in its shuffling and sorting phases.  Additional steps must be incorporated to aid Hadoop's framework during the shuffle and sort phase to achieve total sort.  Three default behaviors must be changed. First, a partition file or function needs to exist inside the mappers. This is where a partition key is generated to instruct Hadoop on how to partition records. Second, internal partition keys inside the reducer need to be dropped. This is where the key used for partitioning is dropped, and the reducer recovers the original (key, value) pairs. Finally, there is a post-processing step to order the partitions. While the partitions are ordered, the partitions keys may not be.\n",

    "Before building our classifier, lets get aquainted with our data. In particular, we're interested in which words occur more in spam emails than in legitimate (\"ham\") emails. In this question you'll implement two Hadoop MapReduce jobs to count and sort word occurrences by document class. You'll also learn about two new Hadoop streaming parameters that will allow you to control how the records output from your mappers are partitioned for reducing on separate nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`IMPORTANT NOTE:`__ For this question and all subsequent items, you should include both the subject and the body of the email in your analysis (i.e. concatetate them to get the 'text' of the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) code:__ Complete the missing components of the code in __`EnronEDA/mapper.py`__ and __`EnronEDA/reducer.py`__ to create a Hadoop  MapReduce job that counts how many times each word in the corpus occurs in an email for each class. Pay close attention to the data format specified in the docstrings of these scripts _-- there are a number of ways to accomplish this task, we've chosen this format to help illustrate a technique in `part e`_. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your code works as expected, then run the provided Hadoop Streaming command to apply your analysis to the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code + short response:__ How many times does the word \"__assistance__\" occur in each class? (`HINT:` Use a `grep` command to read from the results file you generated in '`a`' and then report the answer in the space provided.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Would it have been possible to add some sorting parameters to the Hadoop streaming command that would cause our `part a` results to be sorted by count? Explain why or why not. (`HINT:` This question demands an understanding of the sequence of the phases of MapReduce.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code + short response:__ Write a second Hadoop MapReduce job to sort the output of `part a` first by class and then by count. Run your job and save the results to a local file. Then describe in words how you would go about printing the top 10 words in each class given this sorted output. (`HINT 1:` _remember that you can simply pass the `part a` output directory to the input field of this job; `HINT 2:` since this task is just reodering the records from `part a` we don't need to write a mapper or reducer, just use `/bin/cat` for both_)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ A more efficient alternative to '`grep`-ing' for the top 10 words in each class would be to use the Hadoop framework to separate records from each class into its own partition so that we can just read the top lines in each. Rewrite your job from ` part d` to specify 2 reduce tasks and to tell Hadoop to partition based on the second field (which indicates spam/ham in our data). Your code should maintain the secondary sort -- that is each partition should list words from most to least frequent."

If anything, it leverages functional programming by allowing the user to load different models to perform calculations on other corpora.

Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",

    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace smoothing (where the smoothing parameter $k=1$) makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",

    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ Compare the performance of your two models. What do you notice about the unsmoothed model's predictions? Can you guess why this is happening? Which evaluation measure do you think is most relevant in our use case? [`NOTE:` _Feel free to answer using your common sense but if you want more information on evaluating the classification task checkout_ [this blogpost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\n",

    "> __d)__ The smoothed model has much higher accuracy compared to the unsmoothed model.  This is a result of the unsmoothed model handling terms not seen during training but seen during testing much better than the unsmoothed model.  Notice that the smoothed model has higher precision than the unsmoothed model, yet the smoothed model has a far superior recall.  In this case, the F1-score is most relevant.  These results indicate the smoothed model generalized much better than the unsmoothed model.\n",

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
