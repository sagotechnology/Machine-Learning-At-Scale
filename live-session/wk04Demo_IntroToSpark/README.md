# Week 4 Demo - Intro to Spark

Last week's live session demonstrated some of the limitations Hadoop Streaming. In today's class we'll transition to a new framework: Spark. Although this is not a tools class, the goal of this session is to get you up and coding so that you are able to dive into HW3. We'll also spend a little time exploring how the MapReduce design techniques you learned in the first few weeks will still apply in this new framework.
