# wk6 Live Session Demo: Optimization Theory & Gradient Descent

This week marks a transition in the course: now that we're familiar with some of the basic framework considerations that impact scalability we'll focus more on Machine Learning topics. We'll start with a closer look at Gradient Descent (which you should be familiar with from w207). As usual you'll do your work in  __`demo6_workbook.ipynb`__.

__`IMPORTANT:`__ _Please come to class prepared to share screen with your docker container up and the notebook running. We will be live coding in breakout session._
